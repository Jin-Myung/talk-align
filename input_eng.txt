1. 
We are those who live owing a debt of love to one another. 
We do not live by our own strength alone, but live together, owing each other the debt of love. 
It is said, owe no one anything except the debt of love. 
It testifies that we have a lifelong responsibility to repay the debt of love to one another. 
The apostle Paul says that while we should owe nothing to anyone, love is the only exception.

2. 
What kind of love have we received from the Lord? 
We received eternal love, impossible to repay, freely and unconditionally. 
This love was not given so that we might repay even a little to the Lord. 
This debt of love is not a burden but thanksgiving.

3. 
Do not think of the love received from the Lord as a debt that we absolutely must repay. 
When parents show love to their children, it is not with the thought that their children will repay it later. 
The love that parents show to children is not give and take; how much less, then, would God, who is rich in mercy, give His love with the expectation that we repay Him later?

4. 
God’s love was not given so that we repay, but so that we believe in the Lord who gave it, worship Him with thanksgiving, rejoice in Him, and enjoy Him.

5. 
The important thing is to believe in that love. 
No matter what situation we are in, we are those who believe that we cannot be separated from that love. 
This means we believe the promise that because the Lord’s love is with us, through Him who loves us, we will overwhelmingly conquer in all things.

6. 
We believe that the Lord’s love is greater and stronger than tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, danger, sword, death, rulers, things present, and things to come. 
That love is with us no matter what situation we are in.

7. 
In Psalm 139:9–10 David made this confession. 
Let us read together: “If I take the wings of the dawn, if I dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there Your hand shall lead me, and Your right hand shall hold me.” David believed that no matter what situation he was in, the hand of the Lord’s love would be with him, uphold him, and guide him. 
That is why David could worship the Lord with thanksgiving.

8. 
Returning to the main passage, let us read verse 9. 
“Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not covet,” and it says there are other commandments besides these. 
Paul was once one who claimed to have kept all these commandments.

9. 
Paul once believed himself to be blameless in regard to the righteousness of the law. 
What was evident in the life of one who claimed to have kept all the law? 
The love that the Lord had shown did not appear.

10. 
In the latter part of verse 10, it says that love is the fulfillment of the law. 
Yet in Paul’s life love did not appear. 
He regarded the coming Jesus as a heretical ringleader and opposed Him; far from loving the believers in Jesus, he persecuted them, killed them, and poured all his strength into destroying the church, the body of the Lord.

11. 
Paul, under the pretense of keeping the law, asserted his own righteousness. 
But after the Lord met him, what did Paul realize? 
That it was not through the law that he became righteous, but through the law it was revealed how great a sinner he was, how much he lacked God’s love and love for his neighbor.

12. 
Paul himself had no love, but after receiving the immeasurable love of the Lord who fulfilled the law, he realized that he had become one indebted to love.

13. 
What kind of love did Paul receive from the Lord? 
What kind of love have we received from the Lord? 
Quoting Romans 5:5–8, it says: While we were still weak, while we were ungodly, while we were still sinners, while we were enemies, while we regarded God as an enemy and opposed Him, Christ died for us, and by this God demonstrated His love toward us, and through the Holy Spirit He poured that love into our hearts.

14. 
God gave His Son to those who were His enemies. 
Jesus is the love who died for those who opposed Him. 
If such love was poured out on us when we were enemies of God, then now that we have become God’s children, the guarantee of this love is an indescribable joy and assurance.

15. 
The more we realize how great our own sin is, the more we realize how great and marvelous the love given by the Lord is. 
The Pharisees in the Gospels regarded themselves as righteous to the end. 
That is proof that they did not know the Lord’s love.

16. 
In Luke 7, Jesus was invited to the house of a Pharisee. 
Then a woman in that town who had lived a sinful life came. 
She is thought to have been a prostitute at that time. 
She wet Jesus’ feet with her tears, wiped them with her hair, kissed His feet, and poured perfume on them.

17. 
Then those who were present murmured to themselves. 
They judged, saying, if this man were a prophet, how could He allow a sinful woman to touch Him?

18. 
At that time Jesus asked Simon this question: A man forgave two debtors, one who owed five hundred denarii and one who owed fifty. 
Which one will love him more? 
Simon answered, the one who was forgiven more.

19. 
Jesus rebuked Simon, saying: You gave Me no water for My feet, but this woman wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. 
You gave Me no kiss, but this woman has not stopped kissing My feet.

20. 
You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has poured perfume on My feet. 
Therefore, he who has been forgiven much loves much; but he who has been forgiven little loves little.

21. 
This woman, by the grace of the Lord, realized how great a sinner she was. 
That is why she was able to love the Lord. 
Only when we realize through the Word and the Spirit that we are sinners before God can we love God and love our neighbor. 
Simon and the Pharisees, who considered themselves righteous, did not love the Lord but instead condemned this woman.

22. 
If one does not acknowledge the grace of salvation and does not know that he is a sinner, in the end he will love in his own way for his own benefit. 
That means that if there is no benefit to himself, he will stop loving.

23. 
What is emphasized in verses 8 and 10 of today’s passage is that love is the fulfillment of the law. 
Saying that love is the fulfillment of the law does not mean that we no longer need to keep the law. 
It does not mean we do not need to worship because we love God. 
Because we love, we live with greater gratitude, obeying the law. 
Because we love, even when we serve the Lord, we consider and have compassion on others.

24. 
Let us read Romans 10:4 together. 
“For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.” It says that Jesus Christ is the end of the law. 
It says that Jesus is the fulfillment of the law.

25. 
For what purpose does Jesus become the end of the law? 
To bring righteousness to everyone who believes… This is the important core of the gospel. 
To bring righteousness to everyone who believes…

26. 
What is this righteousness? 
How is this righteousness accomplished? 
It is accomplished only by perfect obedience to the law. 
Jesus accomplished it. 
To justify sinners who were enemies, Jesus Himself perfectly obeyed the law. 
By His obedience, He imputed righteousness to us.

27. 
This is the love of God shown to us. 
God’s love is not only that He gave His Son to the cross, but also that the Son He sent perfectly fulfilled the law in our place and imputed to us the righteousness of Christ. 
Only those who realize and believe this can love God and love their neighbor.

28. 
Finally, let us look at the latter part of 1 Timothy 1:5. 
“Love that comes from a sincere faith.” The apostle Paul says, where does love come from? 
From “faith.” He testifies that in order to love, one must believe in the Lord.

29. 
To love, we must believe in the Lord who died on the cross to save us and who perfectly obeyed the law. 
Love is the fruit of faith. 
Without faith in the Lord, we cannot love as the Lord desires. 
Without believing in the Lord, we can never love the Lord.

30. 
God has made us know His love, understand it, believe it, be assured of it, and rejoice in it. 
But still we doubt that love in our lives, say it is lacking, say we are not receiving it, complain, “Why don’t You love me?”, say it is not there, and even give our hearts to other things, rejoicing in them greatly. 
We are such lacking people.

31. 
When we think of such weakness, it is only distressing and makes us sorry. 
But the more it is so, the more we must look again to the Lord who died for us on the cross and obeyed the law, and thus gain strength.

32. 
Let us read 2 Corinthians 5:14. 
“For Christ’s love compels us.” This word gives great strength. 
The Lord’s love is not the kind of love that says, “Here it is, come take it.” It is love that compels us. 
In the Revised Korean Version it is translated, “Christ’s love takes hold of us.”

33. 
Christ’s love takes hold of us and leads us. 
Just as iron is drawn to a magnet, the Lord’s love takes hold of us and leads us. 
The Holy Spirit works within us.

34. 
The apostle Paul expressed his situation to the Corinthian church like this: “The sufferings of Christ overflow to us, we were burdened beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life, we felt like we had received the sentence of death, we were hard pressed on every side, we faced troubles, we were persecuted, we were struck down. 
But still the love of Christ compelled us to live for the Lord.”

35. 
When children are in their teenage years, they often open the refrigerator several times a day and say, “There’s nothing to eat.” Then we parents say, “There’s tofu, there’s kimchi, there are vegetables and cheese, there’s bread and milk.”

36. 
In the same way, it seems that we often say to our Father God, “There’s nothing.” “This is not there, that is not there.” In reality, God has given us everything—He even gave His Son, He gave eternal life and an eternal kingdom as our inheritance, He gave eternal love and grace. 
Yet because we do not count and consider the love and grace that He has given and promised, we fail to enjoy them and live lacking.

37. 
From the word that love comes from faith, I will add one more thing. 
To have faith in the Lord, to love God, and to love the fellow members together, we must worship the Triune God.

38. 
If we do not worship God, we begin to take our own sins lightly and see the sins of others greatly, criticizing them, and thus great difficulties arise in relationships. 
When we worship God, we receive the strength to love one another as they are. 
Love and respect for one another begin with faithfully worshiping God. 
In worshiping God, we learn the humility, gentleness, and patience of the Lord.

39. 
In verse 10 of the passage, it says, “Love does no harm to a neighbor.” Romans 12:9 says, “Let love be without hypocrisy. 
Abhor what is evil, cling to what is good.” To not do harm to our neighbor, we must hate evil. 
To hate evil, we must love good. 
We must love the Lord.

40. 
We must be careful not to do harm to our neighbor. 
Let us read Psalm 15:3 together: “He who does not slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his neighbor, nor takes up a reproach against his friend.” Not doing harm to a neighbor means not slandering with the tongue, not speaking reproach against a neighbor.

41. 
Beloved saints, I hope that by firmly holding on to the fact that the Lord came to this earth to make us believe in the eternal love of God, obeyed in our place, and died on the cross for us, the love of the Lord and love for our neighbor may abound more in our lives.

42. 
Through the cross of the Lord, may we realize how precious we are to God, and at the same time realize how great sinners we are, so that we may live blessed lives rejoicing in and giving thanks for the love we have received from the Lord and enjoying His grace. 
I pray in the name of the Lord that in this week also you may, by trusting in the Lord, love God and wholeheartedly love and serve your family, fellow believers, and neighbors.
