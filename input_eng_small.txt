1. 
We are those who live owing a debt of love to one another. 
We do not live by our own strength alone, but live together, owing each other the debt of love. 
It is said, owe no one anything except the debt of love. 
It testifies that we have a lifelong responsibility to repay the debt of love to one another. 
The apostle Paul says that while we should owe nothing to anyone, love is the only exception.

2. 
What kind of love have we received from the Lord? 
We received eternal love, impossible to repay, freely and unconditionally. 
This love was not given so that we might repay even a little to the Lord. 
This debt of love is not a burden but thanksgiving.

3. 
Do not think of the love received from the Lord as a debt that we absolutely must repay. 
When parents show love to their children, it is not with the thought that their children will repay it later. 
The love that parents show to children is not give and take; how much less, then, would God, who is rich in mercy, give His love with the expectation that we repay Him later?
